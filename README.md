# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Human Resources (HR) data, built using the `HR_Analytics.csv` dataset. The primary goal of this project is to **[e.g., provide key insights into employee attrition, analyze workforce demographics, track HR key performance indicators (KPIs)]** to enable data-driven decision-making for HR professionals and business leaders.

## Features
* **[e.g., Employee Attrition Analysis]:** Visualize and analyze factors contributing to employee turnover, including departmental attrition rates, job role impacts, and demographic breakdowns.
* **[e.g., Workforce Demographics]:** Explore employee distribution by age, gender, education, department, and job level.
* **[e.g., Performance Metrics]:** Track critical HR KPIs such as average years at company, job satisfaction levels, and total employees.
* **[e.g., Interactive Filters]:** Seamlessly filter data by various dimensions like department, education field, and business travel to drill down into specific segments.
* **[e.g., Salary vs. Performance Insights]:** Analyze the relationship between compensation and performance/satisfaction.

## Technologies & Tools
* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and designing the interactive dashboard visualizations.
* **Power Query (M Language):** Employed for extracting, transforming, and loading the HR data (`HR_Analytics.csv`), including data cleaning, type conversion, and shaping for optimal analysis.
* **Microsoft Excel / CSV:** Source data format (`HR_Analytics.csv`).

## Data Source
The dashboard is built upon the `HR_Analytics.csv` dataset, which contains various employee attributes and performance metrics. This dataset is included in this repository.

## Key Insights / Findings (Example - tailor to your specific findings!)
* Identified that employees in the 'Research & Development' department show a higher **[e.g., job satisfaction rate / attrition rate]** compared to other departments.
* Revealed a correlation between **[e.g., overtime and lower job satisfaction]**, suggesting areas for policy review.
* Pinpointed **[e.g., specific age groups / job roles]** with higher attrition rates, indicating potential focus areas for retention strategies.
